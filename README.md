A standard `create-react-app` with the following modifications;

- folder structure changed
- `redux`
- `react-redux`
- `reselect`
- `redux-sagas`
- `<App/>` is already wrapped in a `react-redux` `<Provider/>`
- a combined reducer is already loaded into the main store with a nearly empty `ui-reducer` thrown in


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
